You wake up one morning and find Alex and Lily standing infront of a abandoned Bart building. 
They turn and look at you with grim expressions... silence 
You look down at your hands and knees they are bruised and dirty. Alex begains to scream, scared you cover your ears.
Pangs of hurt travle from your knees up our spine. You need to make the screaming stop how will you do it?
Suddenly Lily disapears and Alex is left screaming... you try to retrace your memory but can't.
Suddenly out of the fog and thick mist around you you see Lily standing high above on a cliff she whispers your name.
She beckons towards you and suddenly floats away... taking Alex by the arm you prop her up and began to follow the mist.
Suddenly Alex's screaming ceases and she turns to you... she says that you cannot travle where the eye can see you must go through the mist.
As you look to the mountain and into the mist you freeze. WHat if the answers are above with Lily? Then what will you do?
Will you ever get your memory back. Alex freezes and turns towards the mist... choose wisely she says and begins to run faster,
you try to pull her back but she is gone and you are alone what will you choose.

You turn on your side and see Alex sitting before your cross legged on the ground. You are amazed that there is not a single bruise or scar on her as she fiddles around with a neckalice of some sort. As you prop yourself up you relaize that your pangs are gone and in it's place there is fresh healthy looking skin. You turn to Alex confused she does not speak but instead she smiles at you. Welcome home she says softly as you get up. You walk around the dim room. There are no windows which you find awfly weird. Alex reads your mind and speaks calmly,
 "We are in the basment if your Madena home, you loved hanging down here with your family and friends. You would sit donw in thois basement and create things of all sorts being the youngest it was your job to stay home and clean while your eldest and middle brothers were out making a living for your family, where would you like to go?"")
